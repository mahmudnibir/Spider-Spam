## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Pick a Lesson
Start with Lesson 1 (variables) and go in order!

### Step 2: Read the LESSON file
Take your time, read all comments. Don't rush!

### Step 3: Run the EXAMPLE
Compile and see it work!

```bash
gcc 01_example.c -o test
./test
```

### Step 4: Check MISTAKES
Learn what NOT to do before you do it!

### Step 5: Experiment!
Change numbers, try different things, break stuff! That's how you learn!

## 💻 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Go to the folder
cd "C:\Users\G6 Ryzen 5 Pro\OneDrive\Desktop\C\C_Basics"

# Compile any file
gcc filename.c -o myprogram

# Run it
./myprogram
```

### Examples:
```bash
# Try your circle program
gcc 02_math.c -o circle
./circle

# Try your factorial
gcc 04_for_loop.c -o factorial
./factorial

# Try Fibonacci
gcc 08_recursion.c -o fib
./fib
```

---

## ✨ Learning Tips

### ✅ DO:
- Read comments carefully
- Run every example
- Check the mistakes file (super important!)
- Change values and experiment
- Take breaks when confused
- Ask questions (anywhere - forums, ChatGPT, friends)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Skip the mistakes files
- Rush through lessons
- Copy code without understanding
- Give up when stuck
- Compare yourself to others
